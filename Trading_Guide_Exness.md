# 💰 Simple Trading Guide: Web App -> Exness Limit

**Goal**: How to safely use your **Gold Intelligence Web App** to trade on your **Exness Real Account**.

---

## 1️⃣ STEP 1: Check the App Signal
Open your Web App (on phone or PC) and look at the **"Strict Report"**.

### 🛑 STOP / DO NOT TRADE if you see:
*   **Signal**: `WAIT`
*   **Signal**: `WAIT (LOCKED)`
*   **Lock**: `ON`
*   **Confidence**: Between `45% - 59%`

### ✅ READY TO TRADE if you see:
*   **Signal**: `BUY` or `STRONG BUY` (Confidence > 60%)
*   **Signal**: `SELL` or `STRONG SELL` (Confidence > 60%)
*   **Lock**: `OFF`

## 2️⃣ STEP 2: The "5-Minute" Human Check
Your app has a safety lock, but you must be the final boss.

1.  **Time Check**: Is there major news (CPI, NFP, Fed) in the next **5 minutes**?
    *   **YES** 👉 **DO NOT TRADE**. Wait until news passes and Lock turns OFF.
    *   **NO** 👉 Proceed.

2.  **Session Check**:
    *   **London / NY / Overlap** 👉 **High confidence** (Normal Lot Size).
    *   **Asian Session** 👉 **Low confidence** (Half Lot Size or Skip).

## 3️⃣ STEP 3: Execute on Exness
Once Step 1 & 2 are green:

1.  Open **Exness (MT5 / Mobile App)**.
2.  Select **XAUUSD (Gold)**.
3.  **Verify Price**: Ensure Exness price is close to the App's `Gold` price (small difference is okay).
4.  **Enter Trade**:
    *   **For `BUY`**: Open **Buy Order**.
    *   **For `SELL`**: Open **Sell Order**.

### 🛡️ Safety Settings (Recommended)
*   **Stop Loss (SL)**: Place below the recent low (for Buy) or above recent high (for Sell). ~20-30 pips.
*   **Take Profit (TP)**: Aim for 1:2 risk-reward (e.g., risk $10 to make $20).
